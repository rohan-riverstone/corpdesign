    Parameters
    ----------
    generator: Generator[TaskBase, Any, Any]
        Generator orchestrator as defined in the user function app. This generator is expected
        to yield a series of TaskBase objects and receive the results of these tasks until
        returning the result of the orchestrator.

    Returns
    -------
    Generator[Union[TaskBase, Any], None, None]
        A simplified version of the orchestrator which takes no inputs. This generator will
        yield back the TaskBase objects that are yielded from the user orchestrator as well
        as the final result of the orchestrator. Exception handling is also simulated here
        in the same way as replay, where tasks returning exceptions are thrown back into the
        orchestrator.
